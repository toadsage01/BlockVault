# BlockVault by "The Exodus"

Secure your digital assets with blockchain technology.

BlockVault is a Python-based blockchain project built on the Chain Len platform. It provides a robust solution for protecting your digital assets and sensitive information.

## Getting Started

To use BlockVault, you can either install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or run the application directly with:

```bash
python run_app.py
```
## About .pyc Files

BlockVault may generate .pyc files during execution. A .pyc file is a compiled Python code file that contains the compiled bytecode of the corresponding .py file. These files are created to enhance the performance of your Python application.

Please Note: .pyc files should not be modified. They are meant to be executed by the Python virtual machine and are automatically generated when necessary.
